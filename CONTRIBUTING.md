# Yap Community Contribution Guide 1.0

Thank you for interest in Yap, an open source project administered by Young App.
The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:

* Encourages new contributions
* Encourages contributors to remain involved
* Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy

## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting an issue or making pull request.
* A **Committer** is a contributor who have been given write access to the repository.

# Logging issues

Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. 

When in doubt, log an issue, and any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses. Security-related disclosures should be sent in private messages.

# Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes
to documentation, code, binary files, etc.

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that
contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to
weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active committers all have reasonable time to
become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection.
During review committers may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a
particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off"
process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by committers are addressed it can
be landed by any committer.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer, all involved
committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed
by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

# Becoming a committer

All contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be on-boarded in a timely manner,
and added as a committer, and be given write access to the repository.

Committers are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go through
proper review, and have other committers merge their pull requests.
